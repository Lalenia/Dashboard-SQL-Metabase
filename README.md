## Dashboard-SQL-Metabase

In this project, a dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database was built. The database contains all sales transactions between the “Northwind Traders”  company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. For this SQL, AWS and Metabase were used.

Steps to Create the Database and Dashboard:

1. Installing PostgreSQL
2. Creating one table in the database per CSV file
3. Loading the data into the database
4. Creating foreign keys to connect the tables
5. Answering questions on the data in SQL
6. Uploading the data to a AWS RDS cloud database
7. Building an interactive dashboard with Metabase
8. Hosting the dashboard on an AWS EC2 cloud server
